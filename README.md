# Stochastic-p1-Block-Model-Presentation
A class presentation in my undergraduate years for Stat Comprehensive.
* In 1959 Paul Erdos and Alfred Renyi also Gilbert defined a very simple single parameter structure to model random graphs.
* In 1972 Jaroff and Ratcliff gave a generalised iterative algorithm called 'Iterative scalling Algo' for approximating maximum likelihood estimators of a wide class of distributions where the probabilities are in 'product form'.Holland et. al used this method to fit the p1 model.Later on Wang and Wong also used a modified version of this algo for fitting their blocked version.
* Generalizing Erdos-Renyi's model, in 1981 Holland Leinhardt proposed their p1 model with 4 parameters with 2 of them vectors for modeling social networks. It was still quite mathematically sound with nice properties and asyptotic distributions.
* Again in 1987 Holland's phd scholar Yuchung Jeff Wang from Carnegie Melon University modified the probability of assymetic dyads theta_ij to a non-additive one by adding a block parameter to it.
In this presentation these 4 papers are discussed and 2 emperical examples are explored:
* The Sampson's Monastry Experiment(1969)
* The Hansell's Elementary school Experiment(1984)
